# Logistic-Regression-and-KNN-on-MNIST-digits
Implemented and optimized both k-NN and penalized logistic regression model to classify hand-written digits of '4's' and '9's'.  

Plotted visualizations for both models in terms of cross entropy loss and classification error with different hyper-parameters for comparison between models.
